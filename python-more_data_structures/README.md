# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
This project focuses on the practical application of Python data structures like sets and dictionaries. It's designed to enhance understanding of these structures, demonstrating their usage and advantages in various scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Use and explain sets and their common methods.
- Differentiate when to use sets versus lists or dictionaries.
- Iterate over sets effectively.
- Understand dictionaries and their applications.
- Differentiate when to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
- Explain the function and utility of keys in a dictionary.
- Iterate over dictionaries effectively.
- Define and use lambda functions.
- Understand and apply map, reduce, and filter functions.
