## More Info for Python programs
* All Python files is PEP 8(version 1.7) formatted
* All modules, classes and functions(inside and outside a class) have documentations
* Python Scripts - first line of every file is exactly be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3 and executable

* All test files is inside a folder tests
* All test files is text files (extension: .txt)
